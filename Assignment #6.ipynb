    "#Question #1\n",
    "#Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Before OOP we had procedural programming that devide a program into set of functions so we had data stored in a bunch of variables\n",
    "and functions that operates under data this type of programming is very simple and straight forward but as your program grows you will\n",
    "find yourself copying code over and over again right that is we called spaghetti code, \n",
    "there is so much dependency between all these funtions it becomes problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP comes to solve these problems in OOP we define set of related variables and functions in a unit, \n",
    "and we call this unit as an object and we refer these variables as Property and functions as methods  \n",
    "\n",
    "for example we have a class CAR and it has OBJECTS like toyota and Honda etc..\n",
    "OBJECTS are created using methods, methods are like functionality of a objects \n",
    "like we have a car class and it has object honda so basically honda is a car which must have methods or functionality\n",
    "like start() stop() break() etc these are called methods \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "deff: Basically Object Oriented Programming is a technique or methodology in which we use classes and objects to write a program,\n",
    "and we usualy refer problems as an entity in OOP methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "now what are classes and objects,\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically a class is a blueprint or templet for creating objects (a particular data structure), \n",
    "providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), \n",
    "and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP technique make code reusable \n",
    "\n",
    "we have four Pillars in OOP\n",
    "1) Inharitance --> in Inharitance we have one parent class with one or more child classes, \n",
    "                   in this technique child class inharits the properties of a parent class to use them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Encapsulation --> Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). \n",
    "                    It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. \n",
    "                    This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. \n",
    "                    To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. \n",
    "                    Those type of variables are known as private varibale.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Abstraction --> The action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule.\n",
    "                   Abstraction means hiding the complexity and only showing the essential features of the object. \n",
    "                   So in a way, Abstraction means hiding the real implementation and we, as a user, knowing only how to use it.\n",
    " \n",
    "4) Polymorphism --> The word polymorphism means having many forms. \n",
    "                    In programming, polymorphism means same function name (but different signatures) being uses for different types.\n",

    "#Question #2\n",
    "#List down the Benefits of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "OOP has become a fundamental part of software development. \n",
    "Thanks to the ubiquity of languages like Java and C++, you can’t develop software for mobile unless you understand the object-oriented approach. \n",
    "The same goes for serious web development, given the popularity of OOP languages like Python, PHP and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of object-oriented programming lie in this kind of encapsulation. Here’s a detailed look at some of OOP’s top benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modularity for easier troubleshooting\n",
    "    Something has gone wrong, and you have no idea where to look. Is the problem in the Widget file, or is it the WhaleFlumper?\n",
    "    When working with object-oriented programming languages, \n",
    "    you know exactly where to look. \n",
    "    “Oh, the car object broke down? The problem must be in the Car class!” You don’t have to muck through anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "    That’s the beauty of encapsulation. Objects are self-contained, and each bit of functionality does its own thing while leaving the other bits alone. Also, this modality allows an IT team to work on multiple objects simultaneously while minimizing the chance that one person might duplicate someone else’s functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reuse of code through inheritance\n",
    "    This is another advantage of the OOP approach. \n",
    "    Write your peace of code once and use it in a deffrent project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility through polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Effective problem solving\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-oriented programming is often the most natural and pragmatic approach, once you get the hang of it. \n",
    "OOP languages allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve — one object at a time.\n",

    "In our journey with Python so far we’ve seen the Python method and function.\n",
    "what i have learned about i feel that they are prety same to me,\n",
    "\n",
    "lets take a look at both of them\n",
    "\n",
    "Python Functions\n",
    "    Python function is a sequence of statements that execute in a certain order, given a name. \n",
    "    They let us implement code reusability. When we talked about Python Functions, \n",
    "    we talked about built-in and user-defined functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "a. User-Defined Functions\n",
    "    Like any other programming language, Python lets us define our own functions. Let’s take an example.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> def add(a,b):\n",
    "          return a+b \n",
    ">>> add(3,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this function ‘add’. As expected, it adds two values, which it takes as arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Built-in Functions\n",
    "     Built-in Functions are those functions which any programming language provide us to code, \n",
    "     basically whats done in these functions is already defined,\n",
    "     and we dont need to know we just need to know that how can we use them. \n",
    "    These are the functions that Python provides us with, and some of these, we see and use commonly. \n",
    "    Let’s take a look at a program that uses some of these.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python Methods\n",
    "    Python method is like a function, except it is attached to an object. \n",
    "    We call a method on an object, and it possibly makes changes to that object. \n",
    "    A method, then, belongs to a class. Let’s take an example.\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> class vehicle:  #This is car class and in it we have two methods start and showcolor\n",
    "  def __init__(self,color):\n",

    "Now that we’ve revised the Python method and function, we can compare them. Let’s list down the major differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python method is called on an object, unlike a function. In our example above, we call start() on the object ‘car’. \n",
    "Conversely, we call Python function quite generically- we don’t call it on any object. \n",
    "Since we call a method on an object, it can access the data within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A method may alter an object’s state but, \n",
    "\n",
    "Python function usually only operates on it, \n",
